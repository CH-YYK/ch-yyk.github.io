### Problem Statement
Find the Largest square of 1's from a matrix. For example, given a matrix:

$$
  M = \left[ \begin{array}{rrrrr}
  1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 
  0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 
  1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 
  0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 
  \end{array} \right]
$$
Suppose the index set for row and column are 
$$i \in [1,4] \cap \mathbb{N}_{+}$$ and $$j \in [1, 5] \cap \mathbb{N}_{+}$$.

Obviously the largest squre of 1's in this case could be represented by a set of index tuples $$\{(i,j)\ |\ i \in \{2, 3, 4\}\ and\ j \in \{2,3,4\}\}$$.


### Approach (Dynamic Programming)
Let's see how we could use dynamic programming to solve this problem. Figure out how transition function would be used here. Provided an index set $[i, j]$, suppose we only focus on largest square that have the point $M[i,j]$ and $M[i, j]$ is placed at the right-bottom corner. i.e. the interested square, $\hat{M}_{i,j}$, that have $M[i,j]$ must follow

$$
\hat{M}_{i,j} \subseteq \{(i',j')\ |\ i' \leq i\ and\ j' \leq j\}
$$
and the size of $\hat{M}_{i,j}$ is defined by $C_{i,j}$.
Then for a $2\times 2$ sub-matrix of $M$ where the $C_{i-1,j}$, $C_{i-1,j-1}$, $C_{i, j-1}$ are given, $C_{i,j}$ will be determined by the minimum values of these three.

> 1. $C_{i,j} = min\{C_{i-1,j}, C_{i-1,j-1}, C_{i, j-1}\} + 1$ if $M_{i,j} = 1$ else $0$.
> 2. $C_{i,j} = M_{i,j}$ if $i=0$ or $j=0$ (The values at first row or first column are initial values) 

### Codes (python)
Here is the python codes with one example. In the first place, remove Nulls for $M$ should at least have 1 row or 1 column. Then initialize $C$ by duplicating $M$. Update values in $C$ with respect to the transition function above. Finally, find the maximum value in $C$.
```{python}
class Solution:
    def largestSquareOf_1(self, m):
        # eliminate Nulls
        if len(m) == 0:
            return 0
        if len(m[0]) == 0:
            return 0

        C = [[j for j in i] for i in m]
        # update count matrix
        for i in range(len(m)):
            for j in range(len(m[0])):
                if i == 0 or j == 0:
                    C[i][j] = m[i][j]
                elif m[i][j] == 0:
                    C[i][j] = 0
                else:
                    C[i][j] = min(C[i-1][j], C[i][j-1], C[i-1][j-1]) + 1

        # find the maximum value
        maximum = 0
        for i in C:
            maximum = max(maximum, max(i))
        return maximum

if __name__ == '__main__':
    m = [
        [1, 1, 0, 1, 0],
        [0, 1, 1, 1, 0],
        [1, 1, 1, 1, 0],
        [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
    ]
    print(Solution().largestSquareOf_1(m))
```
