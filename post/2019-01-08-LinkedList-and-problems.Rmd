In preparing for the coding interview, I will start writing blogs to record the hints and tips about the basic data structures. The series of the blog will start from *Linked List* in this one.

### Definition:
According to the book, *Cracking the Coding Interview*, a *linked list* is a data structure that represents a sequence of nodes where each node stores a value and points to next node.

```{r eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(diagram)
M <- matrix(data = 0, 5, 5)
names <- c('N1', 'N2', 'N3', 'N4', 'N5')
M[2,1] <- M[3,2] <- M[4,3] <- M[5,4] <- ""
plotmat(M, pos = c(5), curve = 0, name = names, lwd = 1,
         box.lwd = 0.8, cex.txt = 0.8, box.type = "square", box.prop = 1.0, box.size = 0.05)
```

Unlike *array*, *linked list* didn't allow constant time access to a particular "index" within the list. When you have to find the $k$-th element in the list, you have to iterate through k elements.

The advantage of using *Linked List* is that items could be added or removed from the head in constant time.

### A Linked List Node
```{python}
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.next = None
  
    def appendToTail(self, x):
        end = ListNode(x)   # declare an end node
        while self.next:    # iterate to the current ending node
          self = self.next
        self.next = end     # let the current ending node point to the new ending node
```
```{python}
if __name__ == '__main__':
    A = ListNode(1)
    A.appendToTail(2)
    A.appendToTail(3)
    A.appendToTail(4)
    
    print(A.val)    # 1st element
    print(A.next.val)   # 2nd element
    print(A.next.next.val)    # 3rd element
    print(A.next.next.next.val)   # 4th element
    
```


### Some Basic Manipulation of Linked List
#### 1. Remove node from Linked List
*You are given a linked list with much more than one element and an integer Then the task is to write a function that is able to remove the node whose stored value match the given integer*.

> Test the value stored in the next node, when the value matched replace the next node by the more next one.
>

```{python}
# remove the node from linked list
class Solution:
    def removeNode(self, head, value):
        if head.val == value:
            return head.next
        tmp = head
        while tmp.next:
            if tmp.next.val == value:
                tmp.next = tmp.next.next
            else:
                tmp = tmp.next
        return head
```
```{python}
if __name__ == '__main__':
    A = ListNode(2)
    A.appendToTail(2)
    A.appendToTail(1)
    ans = Solution().removeNode(A, 1)
    print(ans.next.next)  # None: 1 has been removed
```

#### 2. print kth-to-last element in the Linked List
*You are given a linked list and the task is to write a function to return the kth elment to last*.
```{python}
# two pointers: keep the difference between two pointers within k-1
class Solution:
    def KthNodeToLast(self, head, k):
        diff = 0
        head2 = head
        while head.next:
            diff += 1
            head = head.next
            if diff >= k:
                head2 = head2.next
        return head2
```
```{python}
if __name__ == '__main__':
    A = ListNode(1)
    A.appendToTail(2)
    A.appendToTail(1)  # A = [1, 2, 1]
    print(Solution().KthNodeToLast(A, 1).val) # 1
```

#### 3. Print the Middle node in the Linked List
*Following the last problem, define an index for the first pointer and make sure the index of the second pointer is half to the first one's*
```{python}
# keep the index of second pointer half to the first pointer
class Solution:
    def middleNodeInList(self, head):
        index = 0
        tmp = head
        while head.next:
            index += 1
            head = head.next
            if index > 0 and index % 2 == 0:  
                tmp = tmp.next
        return tmp
```
```{python}
if __name__ == '__main__':
    A = ListNode(1)
    A.appendToTail(2)
    A.appendToTail(1)
    A.appendToTail(3) 
    A.appendToTail(4)  # A = [1, 2, 1, 3, 4]
    print(Solution().middleNodeInList(A).val) # 1
```

#### 4.(Advanced) Delete the node in the middle
*You are given one Linked List, build a function to delete the node in the middle of the list*
```{python}
class Solution:
    def deleteMiddle(self, head):
        index = 0
        current = head
        middle = head
        pre = ListNode(None)
        pre.next = head
        while current.next:
            index += 1
            if index > 0 and index % 2 == 0:
                middle = middle.next
                pre = pre.next
            current = current.next
        pre.next = pre.next.next
        return head
```
```{python}
if __name__ == '__main__':
    A = ListNode(1)
    A.appendToTail(2)
    A.appendToTail(1)
    ans = Solution().deleteMiddle(A)
    print(A.val)        # 1
    print(A.next.val)   # 1
```
