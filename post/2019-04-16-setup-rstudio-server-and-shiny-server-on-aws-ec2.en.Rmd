In people's traditional views, R always comes along with analysis and statistics. As R users, we all knew that R is not only a local software limited to analysis toolkit but has some powerful features to do fancy things. Thanks to Rstudio team who helped develop fundaments for R community, like Rstudio server for group project and shiny server for hosting shiny apps. Here are some experiences or traps I have encountered in setting these two servers on EC2.

## Overall steps

## Shiny server
